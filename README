This package provides a framework for visualisation.

Requirements
============
In addition to a standard Python installation, this package depends on:
 - gtk
 - pygtk

If you are using virtualenv, please also follow the instructions below to
install gtk and pygtk.  Further instructions for adding these global packages
to your virutalenv are detailed in the "User Installation" and
"Developer Installation" sections below.

Details of the installation of these dependencies on various operating systems
are shown below:

Ubuntu Linux
------------
Execute the following to install both gtk and pygtk:
    sudo apt-get install python-gtk2

Fedora Linux
------------
Execute the following to install both gtk and pygtk:
    sudo apt-get install pygtk2

Windows 7/8 64-bit
------------------
Download the package http://spinnaker.cs.manchester.ac.uk/.../gtk-64.zip and
extract it to the location of your choice.

To install GTK:
 - Extract gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101229_win64.zip to the location of your choice
 - Add the "bin" subdirectory of the extracted archive to the PATH
     * Go to "Control Panel"
     * Go to "System" (may be under "System and Security")
     * Select "Advanced System Settings"
     * Select "Environment Variables"
     * Select the "Path" in the "System Variables" box at the bottom
     * Click on "Edit"
     * Add the new directory by putting it before the existing string, followed
       by a single semi-colon e.g. to add C:\gtk\bin to the Path, prepend
       C:\gtk\bin;

To install pygtk:
 - Install py2cairo-1.10.0.win-amd64-py2.7.exe
 - Install pygobject-2.28.6.win-amd64-py2.7.exe
 - Install pygtk-2.22.0.win-amd64-py2.7.exe

Windows 7/8 32-bit
------------------
Download the package http://spinnaker.cs.manchester.ac.uk/.../gtk-32.zip and
extract it to the location of your choice.

To install GTK:
 - Extract gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101227_win32.zip to the location of your choice
 - Add the "bin" subdirectory of the extracted archive to the PATH
     * Go to "Control Panel"
     * Go to "System" (may be under "System and Security")
     * Select "Advanced System Settings"
     * Select "Environment Variables"
     * Select the "Path" in the "System Variables" box at the bottom
     * Click on "Edit"
     * Add the new directory by putting it before the existing string, followed
       by a single semi-colon e.g. to add C:\gtk\bin to the Path, prepend
       C:\gtk\bin;

To install pygtk:
 - Install py2cairo-1.10.0.win32-py2.7.exe
 - Install pygobject-2.28.6.win32-py2.7.exe
 - Install pygtk-2.22.0.win32-py2.7.exe


User Installation
=================
If you want to install for all users, run:
    sudo pip install Visualiser

If you want to install only for yourself, run:
    pip install Visualiser --user

To install in a virtualenv, it is easier if gtk and pygtk are installed outside
of the virtualenv first.  Then, with the virtualenv enabled, run:
    pip install Visualiser --no-deps
then, depending on which system you are installing on, run:
    32-bit Fedora Linux:            virtualenv-gtk2.0-fedora32.sh
    64-bit Fedora Linux:            virtualenv-gtk2.0-fedora64.sh
    Ubuntu Linux:                   virtualenv-gtk2.0-ubuntu.sh
    Windows 7/8 (as Administrator): virtualenv-gtk2.0-windows.bat


Developer Installation
======================
If you want to be able to edit the source code, but still have it referenced
from other Python modules, you can set the install to be a developer install.
In this case, download the source code, and extract it locally, or else clone
the git repository:
    git clone http://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/Visualiser.git

To install as a development version which all users will then be able to use,
run the following where the code has been extracted:
    sudo python setup.py develop

To install as a development version for only yourself, run:
    python setup.py develop --user

To install as a development version in a virtualenv, it is easier if gtk and
pygtk are installed outside of the virtualenv first.  Then, with the virtualenv
enabled, run:
    python setup.py develop
then, depending on which system you are installing on, run:
    32-bit Fedora Linux:            virtualenv-gtk2.0-fedora32.sh
    64-bit Fedora Linux:            virtualenv-gtk2.0-fedora64.sh
    Ubuntu Linux:                   virtualenv-gtk2.0-ubuntu.sh
    Windows 7/8 (as Administrator): virtualenv-gtk2.0-windows.bat
